## Checking with the name of the device not static id

This branch need to be tested with the devices, compare it with the master to know what have been actually changed.


-- Search with the name, detect the id and store it in a variable, just storing the variable in (Controller/cubits/bleCubit.dart) line 74, need to be checked if it happens correctly.


-- Also snackbar need to be added when the device is found and when it's connected, just to indicate the user with better useability experience.
